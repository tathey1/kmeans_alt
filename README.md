# kmeans_alt

This code accompanies the short document "K-means vs GMM Cost Function" by Thomas Athey, as completed under a lab rotation with Dr. Joshua Vogelstein (https://neurodata.io/) during Spring 2019

In short, this is the beginning of implementations of extensions of k-means for different GMM models.

kmeans_alt.py is the script that calls functions from algs.py

All that is required is numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn
